## **Introduction**
This repository contains implementation details for three system administration tasks:

1. **System Monitoring Setup** 
2. **User Management and Access Control** 
3. **Backup Configuration for Web Servers**

Each task includes step-by-step implementation, configurations, relevant logs, and screenshots.

## **Task 1: System Monitoring Setup**

### **Objective**
To configure a monitoring system that ensures the development environmentâ€™s health, performance, and capacity planning.

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Install Monitoring Tools**
   - Installed `htop` for real-time system performance tracking.
   - Used `df` and `du` for disk usage monitoring.
2. **Configure System Metrics Logging**
   - Created a script to log CPU, memory, and process usage.
   - Set up `cron` to run the script every 1 minute.
3. **Process Monitoring**
   - Identified resource-intensive processes
4. **Logging and Reporting**
   - Configured log output to system_monitor.log.
   - Implemented a reporting structure for periodic review.

### **Expected Output**
- Log files containing system performance snapshots.

## **Task 2: User Management and Access Control**

### **Objective**
To set up user accounts and configure secure access controls for new developers.

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **User Account Creation**
   - Created user accounts for **Sarah** and **Mike** using `useradd`.
   - Set up secure passwords using `passwd`.
2. **Directory Setup**
   - Created isolated working directories:
     - `/home/sarah/workspace`
     - `/home/mike/workspace`
   - Set permissions using `chown` and `chmod` to restrict access.
3. **Enforce Password Policies**
   - Configured password expiration and complexity using `chage` and `passwd`.

### **Expected Output**
- Confirmation of user creation and Screenshots of permission settings.

- Verification of password policy enforcement.

## **Task 3: Backup Configuration for Web Servers**

### **Objective**
To automate backups for Apache and Nginx web servers for data integrity and recovery.

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Backup Script Development**
   - Created a backup script to archive the following:
     - **Apache:** `/etc/apache2/` and `/var/www/html/`
     - **Nginx:** `/etc/nginx/` and `/usr/share/nginx/html/`
   - Compressed the backup files with timestamped filenames.
2. **Cron Job Scheduling**
   - Scheduled backups using `cron` to run every **Sunday after 12:00 AM**.
3. **Backup Integrity Verification**
   - Implemented a check to list the contents of the compressed files after creation.
   - Logged verification results in backup_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.log.

### **Expected Output**
- Backup files stored in `/backups/`.

- Verification log demonstrating backup integrity.
